Version1: Let the site be bare min n good with most necessary info

1) Put animations
Too much also makes it boring. Only at imp places to get attentions maybe
For now:
Slide in fade left right
tada n pulse for icons
https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/content-styles/animations/
on scroll

That's enough for now (version 1 of site)

2) Mini changes
- Better logos
- Different hamburget menu?

3) Fill in the reamaining info (good enough will be enough for now!)

4) Take people's opinion n improve!
